# RoboPlace in web

Use microbit to draw on canvas
users can access the canvas via browser on port 8080

the server.py file is used to run the server (you can run it with a headless server)

the RoboPlace.py file is used to run the application that handles the serial input from microbit (you have to have a display atached)

if you dont need the web version, use this version (https://github.com/C2Coder/RoboPlaceV2)
